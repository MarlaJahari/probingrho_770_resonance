# probingrho_770_resonance
In this study the ρ(770) Resonance is investigated: Analyzing experimental data (E2 vs δ), modelling through T-matrix (from K-matrix and Breit-Wigner formula), fitting and determining the best fit parameters with Chi-square (χ 2 ), predicting the pole position and estimating uncertainties.
